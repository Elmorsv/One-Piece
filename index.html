                There once was a pirate known as the Great Gold Pirate Woonan,
                who obtained almost 1/3 of the world's gold. Over the course of
                a few years, the pirate's existence faded, and a legend grew
                that he disappeared with his gold to a remote island, an island
                pirates continue to search for. Aboard the Going Merry, Luffy
                and his crew, starved and reckless, are robbed of their
                treasure. In an attempt to get it back, they wreck the getaway
                ship, guided by a young boy named Tabio, who's a captured part
                of El Drago's pirate crew. El Drago's love for gold has driven
                him to look for Woonan's island, and thanks to Woonan's treasure
                map, he finds it. During this time, Luffy's crew have been split
                up, and despite their own circumstances, they must find a way to
                stop El Drago from obtaining Woonan's gold.

                Relaxing on a cozy beach, the Straw Hat Pirates are taking a
                rest from their quest. Right until Luffy noticed the Going Merry
                has been hijacked and sailed off from the beach. This leads them
                to search the ship and find the thief who took it from them.
                They ran into a duo named the Theif Brothers, who informed them
